# embed-rerank
A Python-based API service built with FastAPI and PyTorch that performs both text embedding and reranking using such as powerful omni-model Qwen3-Embedding-4B. Designed to load a single model instance in memory to efficiently handle embedding &amp; reranking requests simultaneously, enabling fast and resource-effective operations.
